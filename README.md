My project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression
on the Iris dataset using Python and scikit-learn

what I did here: 

- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Performed train-test split
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Trained Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix Visualized decision boundary
